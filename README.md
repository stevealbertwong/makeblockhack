The physical building of the robot is very similar to the assembly instructions.pdf in the repo.

[here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Learning-Experience-and-Review-the-Makeblock-3-in-/) more on using mblock (makeblock IDE). You could also using arduino IDE to compile with makeblock library. But it is much more convenient to use mblock to compile the code.

Check out our demo of our line following makebot robot that use PID controller feed back line detection error to correct steering angle [here](https://youtu.be/C-BMuusDLDE). It could also grap your water bottle and bring it to you!

Here is a good introduction of using PID control in making your robot!

We also used [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) webhooks and wifi makeblock module to send email to our gmail account with logic in microcontroller.
